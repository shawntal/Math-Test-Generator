# Math-Test-Generator

# Create a program that can randomly generate a series of math problems that can be 
# imported into a Learning Management System (LMS) for the purpose of creating online math tests. 
# The goal is to reduce the manual effort required to create these online math tests
# by having a program generate the test questions, 
# along with varying the questions and answers, instead of a human having to do this task by hand.
